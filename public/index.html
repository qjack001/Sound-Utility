				<h1>
					Why does a website that just displays notebooks need Javascript?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Mostly, because I am lazy. Because the best frameworks, and the ones I am most familiar with, require it. 
					And because, while I could spend my day learning something new — as I mentioned — I am lazy. Am I concerned that
					this trend of thinking will result in websites that are slow to load, bloated with unnessesary code, worse
					for the environment, and bad for SEO? Do I worry that this practice takes away the power visitors have to
					limit their data usage, block ad tracking, and use legacy browsers? Am I weary that for all the hype and
					celebration, that these frameworks will soon themselves become outdated, more prone to failure, and harder
					to maintain? Yes, very much. But here we are.
				</p>
				<p>
					This isn't the website, by the way. This is the error message telling you that you need to <a href="https://www.enable-javascript.com/">turn on Javascript
					to see the website</a>. I'm very sorry. I truly am.
